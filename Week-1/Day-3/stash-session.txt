Stash Workflow Process:

1. Initial Situation:
   I had local uncommitted changes in my working directory that I needed to temporarily save in order to pull the latest updates from the remote repository.
   
2. Stashing Local Changes:
   To save my local changes, I ran the command:
     ```
     git stash
     ```
   - This stored my uncommitted changes and cleaned up my working directory.

3. Pulling Latest Changes:
   - After stashing, I pulled the latest changes from the remote repository to ensure my local branch was up-to-date:
     ```
     git pull
     ```

4. Re-Applying Stashed Changes:
   Once the pull was complete, I re-applied my stashed changes using:
     ```
     git stash apply
     ```

5. Conflict Resolution:
   Conflicts arose after applying the stash. I forgot to reset the `git bisect reset` command. I manually resolved the conflicting file and then staged them:
     ```
     git add <conflicted-file>
     ```
   After resolving the conflicts, I committed the changes:
     ```
     git commit -m "Added stash and resolved bisect merge issue"
     ```

6. Cleaning Up the Stash:
   Once the stashed changes were applied and committed, I ran:
     ```
     git stash drop
     ```
   This removed the stashed entry from the stash list.

7. Outcome:
   - The stash workflow allowed me to temporarily save my changes, update my local branch with the latest changes from the remote, and then reapply my changes without losing any work.
   - After resolving any conflicts and committing, I ensured my code was up-to-date and clean.
